# odin-hangman
## The Odin Project - Hangman

Build a simple command line Hangman game where one player plays against the computer.

## Languages/Technologies used:
 - Ruby
 - VS Code
 - Git/Github
 - YAML

## What I learned:
 - Serialization of objects using YAML
 - How to open, read/write, and save files
 
 
## Still can improve:
 - Do I need to be closing the files anywhere?
 - Potentially can refactor a lot of my if/elsif/else statements
 - Game board display
